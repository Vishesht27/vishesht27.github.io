    <h2>My JEE Journey</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Preparing for JEE was one of the hardest phases of my life. I spent countless hours studying, giving up sleep, hobbies, and even time with friends and family. I worked as hard as I could, aiming to achieve my dream. But when the results came out, I scored 84 percentile, missing the 91 percentile cutoff. It was heartbreaking.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I remember I used for study for 16+ hours in a day. Used to barely sleep for 5 hours, and this went on for months. Just Imagine giving your 100% and still not getting it, how does it feel ? And the worst part, you don't know what else could have been done, and I guess this is life.
    <br>
    <p>
        The failure affected me deeply. I couldn’t get into a top college, and the pain of not clearing the exam still stays with me, even after five years. I had put everything into it, and not achieving my goal felt like I had lost everything—my friends, my relationships, and my confidence.

    <h2>The Lessons Learned</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Over time, I realized that while I didn’t succeed in clearing JEE, I gained something valuable: the habit of working hard. This discipline has helped me face other challenges in life. Whether it’s in my career as a Machine Learning Engineer or other personal goals, the determination I developed during my JEE days keeps me going.

        To anyone going through a similar struggle, remember that success isn’t just about results. It’s about the journey and the growth you experience along the way. My JEE story didn’t end as I hoped, but it shaped me into who I am today, and for that, I’m thankful.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <br>
    Even if we fail, we must not stop giving our best, even in hardest of times, darkest of days, life must go on. Because life works on the concept of butterfly effect. Today when I look back, I feel, whatever happened, it happened for good. And anyone reading it, going through a tough time, I assure you, things are going to get better, just stay calm and trust the Universe and process.
